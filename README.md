# ChemVis
Old project (from 2014) - it is an app which can predict molecules structures using VSEPR method. 

## Requirements
This application requires VTK to be installed on Your machine (version ^7)
https://vtk.org/download/

## Limitations
This program is limited by the VSEPR method, and it won't produce valid results for molecules with untypical ligands attached to the central atom.
